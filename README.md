# Learn Kotlin Coroutines by real examples for Android

## About this project:

* This project is for someone who wants to get started with Kotlin Coroutines.
* I have tried to add the examples we implement in our Android project frequently.

## About me

Hi, I am Amit Shekhar, Co-Founder @ [Outcome School](https://outcomeschool.com) • IIT 2010-14 • I have taught and mentored many developers, and their efforts landed them high-paying tech jobs, helped many tech companies in solving their unique problems, and created many open-source libraries being used by top companies. I am passionate about sharing knowledge through open-source, blogs, and videos.

## Kotlin Coroutines Examples for Android Development: Activity and ViewModel

* **Single Network Call:** Learn how to make a network call using Kotlin Coroutines. This is a very
  simple use-case in Android App Development.
  Blog: [Retrofit with Kotlin Coroutines](https://outcomeschool.com/blog/retrofit-with-kotlin-coroutines)
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/retrofit/single/SingleNetworkCallActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/retrofit/single/SingleNetworkCallViewModel.kt)

* **Series Network Calls:** Learn how to make network calls in series using Kotlin Coroutines. This
  is useful when you want to make a network call which is dependent on an another network call.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/retrofit/series/SeriesNetworkCallsActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/retrofit/series/SeriesNetworkCallsViewModel.kt)

* **Parallel Network Calls:** Learn how to make network calls in parallel using Kotlin Coroutines.
  This is useful when you want to make network calls in parallel which are independent of each
  other.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/retrofit/parallel/ParallelNetworkCallsActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/retrofit/parallel/ParallelNetworkCallsViewModel.kt)

* **Room Database Operation:** Learn how to fetch or insert entity in database using Kotlin
  Coroutines. This is useful when you are using Room Database in your Android Application.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/room/RoomDBActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/room/RoomDBViewModel.kt)

* **Long Running Task:** Learn how to run a long running task using Kotlin Coroutines. If you want
  to do any of your task in background thread using the Kotlin Coroutines, then this is useful.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/task/onetask/LongRunningTaskActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/task/onetask/LongRunningTaskViewModel.kt)

* **Two Long Running Tasks:** Learn how to run two long running tasks in parallel using Kotlin
  Coroutines.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/task/twotasks/TwoLongRunningTasksActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/task/twotasks/TwoLongRunningTasksViewModel.kt)

* **Timeout:** Learn how to add timeout to a task using Kotlin Coroutines. If you want to add a
  timeout to any of your background task in Android, this is going to super useful.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/timeout/TimeoutActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/timeout/TimeoutViewModel.kt)

* **Try-Catch Error Handling:** Learn how to handle error in Kotlin Coroutines using Try-Catch.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/errorhandling/trycatch/TryCatchActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/errorhandling/trycatch/TryCatchViewModel.kt)

* **CoroutineExceptionHandler:** Learn how to handle error in Kotlin Coroutines using
  CoroutineExceptionHandler.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/errorhandling/exceptionhandler/ExceptionHandlerActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/errorhandling/exceptionhandler/ExceptionHandlerViewModel.kt)

* **Ignore Error And Continue:** Learn how to
  use [`supervisorScope`](https://outcomeschool.com/blog/coroutinescope-vs-supervisorscope) to ignore
  error of a task and continue with other task. In other words, if more than two child jobs are
  running in parallel under a supervisor, one child job gets failed, we can continue with other.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/errorhandling/supervisor/IgnoreErrorAndContinueActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/errorhandling/supervisor/IgnoreErrorAndContinueViewModel.kt)

* **Unit Test:** Learn how write unit-test for ViewModel which uses Kotlin Coroutines.
    * [ViewModelTest Code](app/src/test/java/me/amitshekhar/learn/kotlin/coroutines/ui/retrofit/single/SingleNetworkCallViewModelTest.kt)
